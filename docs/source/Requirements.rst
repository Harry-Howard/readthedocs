The User Requirements!
===================================
We designed Study Hive on the Basis that it's an application  made for Students. We first gathered information to find our users needs and wants through interviews and focus groups.
These were the results.

**USER REQUIREMENTS**

- **Searching**: Allow users to search for specific forums, profiles, modules or subjects to recommend study groups or forum posts that allign with what they need.

- **Feedback and Ratings**: Allow users to have input on forums via liking and commenting on different forum posts.

- **Forums**: Allow for users to post a question, allowing for others to help. These are tailored by subject, modules or coruses depending on what the user decides.

- **Friends**: Users have the ability to add friends. In which they can see their posts and interests, as  well as see what group chats your friends can be.
