The User Requirements!
===================================
We designed Study Hive on the Basis that it's an application  made for Students. We first gathered information to find our users needs and wants through interviews and focus groups.
These were the results.

**USER REQUIREMENTS**

-  **User Profiles**: A page that would allow users to have some basic customisation features (a bio, a profile picture, the course they are studying, and the number of friends they have).

- **Searching**: Allow users to search for specific forums, profiles, modules, or subjects to recommend study groups or forum posts that allign with what they need.

- **Group Chat Creation**: Allow users to create group chats in which others can join depending on what the user's preferences are (public or private). 

- **Feedback and Ratings**: Allow users to have input on forums via liking and commenting on different forum posts.

- **Forums**: Allow for users to post a question, allowing for others to help. These are tailored by subject, modules, or courses, depending on what the user decides.

- **Friends**: Users have the ability to add friends. In which they can see their posts and interests, as  well as see what group chats your friends can be. 

- **Notifications**: Users will recieve notifications depending on their preference. Study group notifications could be notified, and when they haven't been on the app in a while, a push notification could happen.

- **Gamification**: Users should have access to leaderboards and earn badges depending on the material they are sharing, how active they are, and how high their rating is based on feedback (likes/dislikes) on their forums or comments.
