The Scope of our project! 
===================================

The Scope of our Study Hive Application was to make a user friendly interface where students can ask questions and interact with eachother via the use of **forums** and **group chats**. We wanted to make an interactive interface that users could give feedback on others work and ask for help with work when they need. We allowed this for users by allowing them to post and comment onto these forums, with the ability for users to upload their own files onto forum posts to help get their point across to others. This is also allowed in groupchats and will be monitored by our moderation team.
