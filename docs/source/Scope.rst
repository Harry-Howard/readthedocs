The Scope of our project! 
===================================

The Scope of our Study Hive Application was to make a user friendly interface where students can ask questions and interact with eachother via the use of **forums** and **group chats**. We wanted to make an interactive interface that users could give feedback on others work and ask for help with work when they need.


We aim to bring gamification to our project and can offer future development to bring Study Hive to a wider variety of platforms and the potential of adding voice chats to private group chats or limit the number of particiapnts if voicechats were to be included.
